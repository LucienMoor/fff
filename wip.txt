# GitHub repository guidelines

This document is to provide a guideline on how to create and configure a gitHub repository in the Agridea organization. The goal is to have a shared standard for our repositories to facilitate collaboration and readability.



These guideline is not enforced and ar, if there is a valid reason to make things differently, feel free to do so and share it with others!

## Naming convention

the naming convention for repository is  `lowercase-dashes-pattern`. everything should be in lowercase, with dash separating words. Avoid using any words that might change overtime (person name, group number,..) as it renaming a repository can break links.

example of repository names for a project named `project1`

```
project1-api
project1-frontend
project1-testing
```

## minimal readme
At minimum, the readme should provide a description and the tools to install and run the project. The readme should be written in english

## repository organization

the repository organization inside the Agridea Organization (in addition to a good naming convention!) is done with Teams and Topics. At minimum, each repository should be associated to a Team (Acorda, ...) If a project has a lot of repositories (e.g. multiple micro-services) it is recommended to create a specific Team for this project.

In adition do that, it is also recommended to add Topic to your projects, to describe what subject the project is talking about (e.g. `Finance` , `Direct payment`,  `Security`,...)
